# RPG Collection - Task 3

This is a simple RPG Character system where it is possible to create 3 types of characters -
warrior, ranger and mage. It is also possible to create weapons and armor to equip the character with in this system. 
There are two types of weapon - melee weapon and ranged weapon, 
and there are three types of armor - cloth, leather and plate.
The program is set up in a way which makes it possible to expand the system by for example 
adding new types of character or new types of items.
